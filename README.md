# lab9

To write and test more efficiently I set up a make file where I can quickly compile code.

$make all  –> this will output two executable files main, and unit_test

$./unit_test  –> will run the code through unit testing

$./main  –> this will run the code through my main function

$make clean  –> this will clean up any existing executable files and delete them
